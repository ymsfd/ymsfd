I am a naive student who has three minutes passion on everything.
But I want to/will be an expert in computer science, with focus on machine learning and natural language processing.
The reason I started this blog is encourage myself to output more often rather than always and only take inputs from others, to
be a person that still able to think in the currnt time.

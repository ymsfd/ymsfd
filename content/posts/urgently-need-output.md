I realized I could not write anymore, I read too much and too fast that I did not leave time for thinking.
This is a disaster for my brain, and for my till now still not finished report which supposed to be finished one year ago.
Because I forgot how to write, how to output thoughts, and the longer the delay, the more my brain refuse to think, refuse to start from any single
tiny step..

Willpower and pressure are enemy.
I am afraid of things to comes in the future, and I tend to over-worry about the consequences brought by a tiny bit case. I guess I am one part of the so-called HSP group.
I do have a strong willpower, at least I had it before, otherwise I could not make the multiple marathons in the past.
But where are they now? I am burried in the invisible pressure day by day, night by night. I often sleep like awake, open my eyes in the middle of endless darkless, try to convince my body that it is
sleeping, recovering, regenerating. But I am lying, and the lie can not live longer than second day morning, when I have to wake up my extrememly exhausting body out of the whole night's fight and lost.
I kept dreaming of my long-passed-away grandpa, I never was there in his last few minutes in life. But in my dream, I am witnessing him dying, getting weaker, smaller, shrinking, and gone.
This is the second time within one week that he appeared in my dream.
Or is it a dream? Dream exists when the body is in deep sleep. Did my body ever felt into that deep cozy zone? I have no idea of. The only feeling I can remember every morning when waking up is exhausing,
more tired than last night, confused, what am I going to do today, will that make a difference to the current situation?
I am losing my sleep and my willpower. They are both murdered by stress.

As a newbie to web frontend knowledge, I want to use the minimum effort to build a working blog to records
study output. Thus Hugo plus GitHubPages are the first choice for me to go.


* OS: Ubuntu 20.10
* hugo version: v0.74.3

# install hugo in ubuntu

# test hugo locally

# host on GitHubPages

# customize config file/page layout

# update new posts
